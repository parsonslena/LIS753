<h2 id="#about">About</h2>
<p>Every month on the second Saturday and Sunday, Friends of the Palo Alto Library holds a huge sale of more than 50,000 gently used and sometimes new books, CDs, DVDs, VHS, LPs, as well as puzzles, games, and software. 
  Most items have been donated by individuals, estates, and companies in the community; a few are former library books. 
  Everything is sorted and displayed by genre and subject for easy browsing. </p>
