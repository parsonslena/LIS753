                Hello! I am Lena Parsons and I believe this is my last regular class before graduation next spring! (Still waiting for the registrar to get back to me‚Ä¶) I have been a slow track, career changer student taking one class at a time since January 2020. I‚Äôm in the process of closing up my public relations consultancy I‚Äôve had for ten years or so. I left big firms when my older kids were little and now I‚Äôm ready to leave PR for archiving/specialized libraries.
            I work part time in records retention at the Saint Louis Zoo. My family moved to STL almost two years ago from Oak Park. I have four kids - 14,12, 7, 5. I am most excited for them to see me graduate next spring. 
            I do not have any coding experience since a computer science class in undergrad in the late 90s üëµüèªbut I have lots of project management experience in the area. I look forward to getting it done together!
            Thanks for reading and be well.
